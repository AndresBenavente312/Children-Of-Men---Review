        Guys Children of Men is so good. Everyone needs to watch this movie. I cried twice and I don't cry in movies.
        <br>The cinematography is amazing. The editing is so good half the time you don't even realize there are oners.
        <br>The acting is superb. The music is spectacular. The messsages and themes are still relevant today.
        <br>Watch Children of Men, do it. Do it now. Right now. Please? With a cherry on top?
